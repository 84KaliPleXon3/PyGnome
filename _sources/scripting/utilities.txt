Scripting utilities
====================================================

GNOME has a scripting module where many utilties and helper functions can be accessed to simplify
common tasks. These include helper functions for easier creation of certain types of spills and movers.
To use these functions import gnome.scripting

:mod:`gnome.scripting`
