    "The size distribution of oil droplets formed in deep water oil and gas blowouts is known to have strong impact on the subsequent fate of the oil in the environment (<b>Johansen, 2003</b>).  Deep water blowouts are more sensitive to crossflow and ambient density stratifications than blowouts in moderate to shallow water.  This is due to reduced buoyancy cused by the strong compression of the gas in deep water, together with other factors such as non-ideal gas behavior and the potential for a substantial fraction of gas dissolved in the oil phase.<br/>\n",
    "In blowouts from moderate to shallow depths, the large buoyancy generated by the expanding gas will in general bring the plume of entrained water to the sea surface together with dispersed oil droplets and gas bubbles.  A relatively homogeneous thin surface oil slick will then form as the dispersed oil droplets settles out of the outward flow of the surfacing entrained water.  A deep water plume (with small buoyancy) is more likely to be trapped by the ambient density stratification or bent over by crossflow.<br/>\n",
    "In both cases, gas bubbles and oil droplets will separate from the plume and rise to the surface with their own terminal velocities.  Large droplets will rise relatively rapidly and come to the surface relatively close to the discharge location, while small droplets will rise more slowly and can be transported long distances from the discharge location with ambient currents before reaching the sea surface.  The smallest droplets may even be kept suspended in the water masses for prolonged time periods by vertical oceanic turbulent mixing, subject to enhanced dissolution and natural biodegradation.<br/>\n",
    "Releases which are predominantly producing large oil droplets (in the millimeter size range) may thus result in relatively thick surface oil slicks, while thin surface films may be expected from releases producing small droplets (micrometer range).  Thin oil films may not form water-in-oil emulsions and will thus be more susceptible to natural dispersion.  This implies that films will have distinctly shorter persistence on the sea surface than thicker oil slicks, and the possibility of oiling of adjacent shorelines may thus be strongly reduced."

    "Reliable predictions of the droplet size distribution in deep water blowouts will thus improve our ability to forecast the fate of oil in the environment, provide guidance for oil spill response operations and relevent information to the public.  Presently, the only available experimental droplet size data at near full scale was obtained in the DeepSpill experiment conducted at 844M in the Norwegian Sea (<b>Johansen et al., 2003</b>).  These limited observations have formed the basis for a Weber number scaling based prediction method for droplet size that are used in many deep water blowout models today (<b>Chen and Yapa, 2007</b>).  Other studies of oil droplet breakup have been conducted at a much smaller scale (<b>Masutani and Adams, 2000; Tang and Masutani, 2003</b>), but extrapolation of such small scale results to larger scales are doubtful.<br/>\n",
    "However, more recently, SINTEF has initiated laboratory studies of oil droplet breakup in a meso-scale test facility, comprising a cylindrical tank with a height of 6m and a diameter of 3m.  This test facility is presented in a companion paper, with a description of the experimental setup and examples of findings from oil only experiments and experiments with injection of chemical dispersants (<b>Brandvik et al., in press</b>).  In this paper, we present a new model for prediction of initial droplet size distributions in subsea oil and gas releases that has been derived from the experimental data presented in the companion paper, supported by findings from a review of theoretical aspects of droplet breakup."

    "Based on recently obtained data from droplet breakup experiments at the new tower tank facility at SINTEF, we have derived a new consistent method for prediction of droplet size distributions of oil emerging from subsea blowouts, both with untreated oils and oils treated with dispersants.  The method first provides an estimate of the volume median diameter $d_{50}$ based on the exit conditions (volume flow of oil, gas void fraciton, and exit diameter)."

    "The droplet size distribution can then be obtained from the median droplet size by assuming a Rosin-Rammler distribution with parameters $k = 0.693$ and $\\alpha = 1.8$.  The cumulative volume $V(d)$ corresponding to a given droplet diameter $d$ will then be given by the distribution function given in Eq. 5 with these values of $k$ and $\\alpha$."

    "A lognormal distribution function seemed to give a better fit in a few cases, but from an overall point of view, we recommend the Rosin-Rammler function, especially since this function was found to fit the droplet size data available from the DeepSpill experiment.<br/>\n",
    "From the exit variables, an effective exit velocity $U_C$ is obtained, as explained in Section 3.  The median droplet size prediction is then obtained from the modified Weber number model expressed by Eq. 3 with parameters $A = 15.0$ and $B = 0.8$, and $U_C$ replacing $U$ in the Weber and viscosity numbers (see Appendix A for an overview).<br/>\n",
    "As mentioned previously, these coefficients should be conceived as preliminary due to the limited data set available in this early stage in the experimental study.  Still, we have reason to believe that the modified Weber number concept will survive further tests, even if the coefficients $A$ and $B$ will change to some extent."

    "In cases without treatment with chemical dispersants, the modifying term in the brackets of Eq. 3 might be expected to be close to 1, while the increase in the viscosity number due to a reduction in IFT after treatment with dispersants should cause this term to be significant.  However, it is interesting to note that the modified Weber numbers computed from experimental data is significantly reduced compared with the standard Weber numbers, also in the cases without treatment (compare filled markers in <b>Figs. 8 and 9</b>).  A close examination of the data shows reduction factors ranging from 4 to 8, with the largest reduction found for the case with the largest exit velocity $(26.5 m/s)$.<br/>\n",
    "A significantly smaller reduction factor of about 1.3 was found in the DeepSpill marine diesel experiment, where the exit velocity was an order of magnitude smaller: $1.5 m/s$ for oil only and $2.5 m/s$ after corrections for void fraction and buoyancy.  This seems to imply that the viscosity term can have a significant effect in laboratory scale experiments with untreated oils, while void fraction and buoyancy effects are more important in near full scale cases."

    "The IFT may be reduced by several orders of magnitude by treatment with chemical dispersants, but the relationship between DOR and IFT is not well established, and may vary with the application method and for different oils and dispersants.  In this study, the IFT values corresponding to a given DOR were determined from measurements on oil samples taken within the plume.  In real cases, <i>in situ</i> sampling may be impractical, and some method for prediction of IFT related to a given DOR will be useful.  IFT measurements with a variety of oils premixed with different dosages of dispersants might help to establish such relationships in more general terms."
