[1] reported rapid transport of large oil droplets and slow transport of smaller droplets, causing the formation of the comet-shaped oil slick on the water surface.<br/>\n",

    "The droplet size distribution (DSD) is not only important for the transport of oil but also for is fate, as increasing the portion of small droplets results in an increase in the surface area (per unit mass).  A large surface area enhances the dissolution of hydrocarbon components in the water column [4].  In addition, as the biodegradation of low solubility oil components in the droplets occurs at the water-oil interface, and increase in the surface area increases oil biodegradation [5, 6].<br/>\n",

Correlations (or correlation models) rely on dimensionless numbers, such as the Weber number - ratio of destructive forces to resisting forces due to interfacial tension (IFT), and the Reynolds number to obtain characteristic diameters at steady state (i.e., after a long time of mixing) [e.g. [7-10]].<br/>\n",

Droplet coalescence was accounted for explicitly in these approaches.<br/>\n",

In spite of many peer reviewed studies using population balance models, only few studies considered oil viscosity effects in droplet breakage, and these occurred under steady-state conditions [11,26].<br/>\n",

    "Therefore, in the context of dealing with oil spills in marine environment, the objective of this paper was to develop a numerical model - VDROP using population balance equation to predict the transient and steady-state DSD of oils of various properties.  In particular, the model accounts for resistance to breakup of droplets due to viscous forces within the droplet.  The VDROP model was extensively validated using experimental data from chemical reactors.  The model was then used to simulate the DSD resulting from an oil slick in breaking waves."
