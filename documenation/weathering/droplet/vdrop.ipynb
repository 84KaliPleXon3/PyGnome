From energetic point of view, Tsouris and Tavlarides [24] proposed a daughter drop probability density function, which considered that the energy requirement for a breakup into a small and a large drop is less than the energy requirement for a breakup into two equal-size droplets, suggesting that breakup into different volume droplets is more probable.  The probability of obtaining a droplet of size $d_i$ due to the breakup of a parent droplet of size $d_j$, $\\beta(d_i, d_j)$ can be expressed as [24]:"
