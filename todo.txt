WIP - finish by 5/12/2015:
===========================
Following changes are in mass_balance branch - needs testing

- SpillContainer should update 'amount_released', 'floating' as well

x currently WeatheringData() updates all 'mass_balance', let SpillContainer/map update 'beached',
  'off_maps'
x remove particles that go off maps 

WeatheringData() and spreading objects automatically added:
x must be the last thing we do in weather_elements() -- before age is incremented
x make sure spreading works fine
x Langmuir must happen in weather_elements, but it must get initialized after spreading initializes 'area'
x Maybe include 'area', remove 'fay_area' and
  include 'frac_coverage' data array
x fix broken tests in test_weathering_data()

Documentation:
x added ipynb analyses to gnome/documenatation/.
- API documentation for movers, weatherers (Process). Save/Load

Incomplete/comments:
--------------------
- update spills to end_position equals start_position, end_release_time, release_time
- WeatheringData() and spreading classes should always set active_start and active_stop to -inf and inf.
  Other weatherers require these - in the most common case, these will be automatically constructed and
  active_start/stop will default to -inf/inf.
- add tests for Langmuir integrated into model.
  See ipynb in gnome/documentation/weathering/evaporation/spreading_langmuir.ipynb
  was testing it manually though maybe good to include it in test_persist.py and test_model.py
- clean up Model to set 'iscollection' attribute for (movers, weatherers, environment, outputters),
  and use base class serialize/deserialize
  - tried this but got errors so abandoned the idea. It works as it is and will reduce code by a
    few lines but not much so abandoned this refactor for now.

======================

ISSUES:
-------
oil_library:
- get_oil_props() not working for some oils

Model:
------
- cleanup Model code - lots of rewinds. Need to check for None. time_step can be int or timedelta

Model should update some data in sc.weathering_data dict:
- some keys like 'beached' and 'off_maps' - should be present for traj also. Let model
  or sc set these instead of WeatheringData(). This is aggregated data.

Model validation:
- double check lat/long - do validation in Model for lat/long of Wind
- model needs to check if spill is in the Map's spillable area - add to validate()
- also check if spill is onland   

Model exceptions:
- added exceptions, though not used everywhere - need to raise gnome exceptions

Documentation:
- move evaporation notebooks to documentation
- model exponential decay versus euler method 

Colander schemas/save/load:
- revisit serialize/deserialize NumpyArraySchema + inefficiency in serial/deserial wind structure
- could refactor and make serialize/deserialize more general and put it in base class
- document various mixins and base classes
- colander.drop doesn't seem to work for LocalDateTime() objects - need to dig into this with simple example
- scale_refpoint not being deserialized if only (long, lat) is given!

Weathering: 
- BIODEGRADATION
- once LEs get marked for cleanup, should they be included for updating intrinsic - ask? 
  Mostly effects spreading
- automatically stop when 'mass' % reaches X%
- added split_element() but is incomplete. Currently only required for cleanup.

__eq__:
--------
- want a way to tell which objects and which attributes are different when eq fails

pytest issues:
---------------
- py.test -n 4 --runslow --basetemp=dump fails, but
  py.test -n 4 --runslow passes .. need to figure out why
- some way for pytest to skip tests for missing data


Big refactors/todos:
====================
SpillContainer:
Generalize concept of subselecting LE data:
-------------------------------------------
- revisit concept of FateDataView() in SpillContainer integrate 'status_codes' and 'fate_status'
- want a bit array for 'status' of each LE which includes weathering
- movers or weatherers should be able to get LE data by 'status' or by 'substance' and 'status'
- new code in there without adequate tests


outputters/netcdf_outputter
----------------------------
- want ability to get data at specified timesteps 
- for Renderer, change images_dir to output_dir - consistent w/ other outputters
- active_start = active_stop only raises exception on __init__ .. make it so it always raises exception?
