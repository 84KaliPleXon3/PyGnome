Web Services
============

The WebGnome JavaScript/HTML application is powered by a set of JSON web
services. These services follow a RESTful design approach -- i.e., they are
oriented around the idea of a "resource" that you may query using HTTP verbs:
GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

See below for documentation on the individual services available.
