When setting up these projects on the new machine, perform the following
steps:

- Start up Eclipse.  You can create a new workspace, or use a pre-existing
  one as long as it does not already contain these projects.  (Eclipse
  is usually pretty good about not double-importing projects.

- In the Project Explorer pane, right click and choose Import...
  Alternatively, you can choose the File->Import... from the top menu bar.
  You will be presented with an Import Dialog window.

- From the Import dialog, choose General->Existing Project Into Workspace.

- You need to choose a root directory that Eclipse can use as a starting
  point to search for projects.  Browse and select the directory that
  contains this file.
  You will then be presented with a list of projects to import.

- From the list, check any projects you want to import.  Likewise,
  uncheck the ones you don't want.

- click Finish.
