##    BINARY dependencies: cannot be pip installed
##    Following packages requires something more than pip install
##    since they have binary dependencies. Following packages are commented
##    so pip does not try to install them. Please look at install directions
##    in README.md for instructions on installing for your OS.

netCDF4>=1.1.0            # requires netcdf-4 binaries and hdf5

## projections uses interpolate routine so most of py_gnome will work without this
#  gsw also uses scipy. Expect py_gnome users with a local install to have scipy
