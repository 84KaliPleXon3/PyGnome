README for the py_ugrid package

The ugrid package is collection of code for working with an manipulating unstructured grids and the data on them

It is being developed by an informal group of folks that work with unstructured grid models and needed a way to manipluate the grid and results in Python.

The core data model is designed to match the model proposed by an informal working group on representing unstructured grids in the netcdf file format. A description of that data model can be found here:
