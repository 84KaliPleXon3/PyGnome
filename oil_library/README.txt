OilLibrary README
==================

Getting Started
---------------

- cd <directory containing this file>

For develop (editable) mode:
..................


``$ python -m pip install -e ./``


To Install
..........

``$ python -m pip install ./``

(using pip, rather than plain setup.py install, will prevent setuptools from trying to build an egg file -- which fails due to not putting the raw data file in the egg.)
